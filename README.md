# Light stone plugin for Konstructs

Light stone is an ore that emits light all by itself. The amount of light it emits can be controlled by the amount of light it receives. Due to these special properties it can be used for all sorts of interesting control mechanisms. This plugin provides the following blocks:

- Light stone ore
- Light stone emitter
- Light stone mirror
- Light stone lamp

## Light stone ore

Light stone ore spawns in normal stone and can be extracted using any tool capable of destroying stone. It is by itself a low level light source.

## Light stone emitter

A light stone emitter is constructed from light stone and can be used to emit invisible light up to 16 blocks in one direction. It can be manually (tertiary action) turned on and off.

## Light stone mirror

A light stone mirror is utilizing the special properties of the light stone to either reflect (and amplify) incoming light at a 90 degree angle or let it pass through (also amplified). The two different states are triggered by light being emitted at the face of the light stone mirror that is opposite of the face out of which the light passes at the 90 degree angle.

## Light stone lamp

A light stone lamp transforms light emitted onto one of its side into visible light. This light is visible in all directions.
